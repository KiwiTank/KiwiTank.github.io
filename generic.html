									<h1>From Rocks to Code</h1>
									<p>Before breaking into data science and AI, I studied and worked as a geoscientist, primarily in the oil & gas industry. Below is a brief insight into my journey from rock doctor to data scientist.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/rocks.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I've had a passion for geology since discovering it during my first undergraduate year in New Zealand, and have studied and worked in the field for over 20 years. Following the completion of my BSc in Geology, with First Class Honours, I took a job in iron ore mining in Western Australia, before going back to uni to complete a PhD in carbonate sedimentology. </p>
								<p>After completing my studies, I went on to work in oil and gas exploration for Statoil in Norway, where I was involved in many interesting and varied projects all around the world. My geoscience journey then continued with GNS Science (effectively the New Zealand Geological Survey), after which I then joined CGG in North Wales as a Senior Petroleum Geoscientist.</p>
								<p>All of these roles exposed me to a vast range of data types, from geophysical and petrophysical data like 3D seismic cubes and wireline well logs, to analytical and interpretive data such as rock core and outcrop palaeoenvironmental analyses. Through my years in this fascinating field I have become an expert at combining a wide variety of data types and extracting the story the data wants to tell us. This ultimately led me to my new career in data science!</p>
